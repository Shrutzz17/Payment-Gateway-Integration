# Payment-Gateway-Integration
A simple website where payment gateway is integrated.

◇ There is a simple DONATION button present on the homepage. On clicking the donation button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the cause for donation and the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.

◇ Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.

◇ On any page / email, only basic information is needed.
